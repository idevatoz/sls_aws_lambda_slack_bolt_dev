To download libraries in slack_bolt_libs/python directory rather installing them: 
pip install -t slack_bolt_libs/python -r aws_requirements.txt

cd slack_bolt_libs
zip -r -q ../slack_bolt_libs.zip ./python/

To extract the zip file to different directory:
unzip slack_bolt_libs.zip -d ~/temp_then_del_me

zip -sf slack_bolt_libs.zip


Limitations of Lambda Layers
There are a few limitations that you need to be aware of and this includes:
- You can only use up to 5 layers per Lambda.
- The size of all your layers unzipped cannot exceed 250mb.
- Layers are mounted to the /opt directory in the functionâ€™s execution environment 
  so be sure to Layer your functions properly if you are going to have more than one.
